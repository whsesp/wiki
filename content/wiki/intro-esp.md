Welcome to the ESP Spanish Wiki! Here's some _essential_ knowledge to kick-start your Spanish learning journey! The first lesson is fairly long, so feel free to take breaks in between. You are expected to look up words you do not know in a [dictionary](https://www.spanishdict.com/).  


## Spanish Alphabet (_el abecedario_) {#spanish-alphabet--el-abecedario}

Spanish uses the latin alphabet (a-z) plus some Spanish-only letters. Below is the Spanish alphabet and what they are called in Spanish. You should also watch this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vudw7GtB034) to learn about their pronunciation.  

-   a: _la a_ (see video)
-   b: _la be_
-   c: _la ce_
-   d: _la de_
-   e: _la e_ (see video)
-   f: _la efe_
-   g: _la /ge_ (h sound)
-   h: _la hache_ (silent)
-   i: _la i_ (pl. las íes) (long _e_ sound; see video)
-   j: _la jota_ (h sound)
-   k: _la ka_
-   l: _la ele_
-   m: _la eme_
-   n: _la ene_
-   ñ: _la eñe_ (ñ = ni)
-   o: _la o_ (see video)
-   p: _la pe_
-   q: _la cu_
-   r: _la erre_ (pronounced like "l" between vowels, otherwise roll the r)
-   s: _la ese_
-   t: _la te_
-   u: _la u_ ("ooh" sound; see video)
-   v: _la uve_
-   w: _la uve doble_ (lit. double u)
-   x: _la equis_
-   y: _la i griega_ (lit. the Greek "i")
-   z: _la zeta_ (pronounced "s")
-   ch: _la che_
-   gu: N/A (pronounced like "g" in English)
-   ll: N/A (pronounced like "y" in English)
-   qu: N/A (voiceless velar plosive; see video)
-   rr: _la erre doble_ / _doble erre_ (roll the r)


## Stress & Accents {#stress-and-accents}

Stressed syllables are pronounced slightly louder, a bit longer, and higher in pitch than other syllables, e.g. "a" in _dance_ and "u" in _butterfly_. In Spanish, the second-to-last syllable will be _stressed_ unless indicated by an accent, e.g. "i" in _la comida_ (food). If the word ends in a consonant (i.e. not a, e, i, o, u), then the last syllable is stressed unless the consonant is _n_ or _s_, e.g. "u" in _ayuda_, "é" in _el teléfono_, "e" in _carnet_, and "i" in escribir.  


## Gender {#gender}

Spanish nouns have gender. Usually, nouns ending in -o are masculine, like _nacho_, and words ending in -a are feminine like _agua_. This is a general pattern and you will see many exceptions to it. Other patterns will emerge as you learn more Spanish. Be mindful of this pattern as you go.  


## Article {#article}

The word "the" in Spanish has two forms: _el_ and _la_. The former is used on masculine nouns (e.g. _el profesor_), and the latter on feminine nouns (e.g. _la profesora_). However, when the word begins with a stressed "a" sound, you use _el_ instead of _la_ on singular feminine nouns (e.g. _el agua_ instead of _la agua_; _las aguas_ stay the same).  


## Subject Pronouns {#subject-pronouns}

Instead of nouns, you can use _subject pronouns_ as the subject of an action. For example, you can say _He ate the apple_ instead of _The trainee ate the apple_. Here is a list of pronouns in Spanish.  

| Category                 | Singular            | Plural                  |
|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| First person             | yo = I              | nosotros, nosotras = we |
| Second person (informal) | tú (informal) = you | vosotros = you          |
| Second person (formal)   | usted (Ud.) = you   | ustedes (Uds.) = you    |
| Third person             | él = he, ella = she | ellos, ellas = they     |

-   Spanish has two different words for "you" based on your familiarity with whomever you are talking to. If you are talking to your friend, family member, or someone younger than you, use _tú_. If you are talking to a stranger or an elder, for example, you should use _usted_ to show respect.
-   Note that subject pronouns ending in -a or -as applies to female(s) only! For example, you can only use _ellas_ on a group of women but you need to use _ellos_ when there are men in the group.


## Present Tense Verb Conjugation {#present-tense-verb-conjugation}

Like many other languages, you need to conjugate a verb from its _infinitive form_ (e.g. _to swim_ in English or _nadar_ in Spanish) in order to use it (e.g. _he swims_ in English and _él nada_ in Spanish). How you conjugate the verb depends on the subject pronoun that is appropriate for the person taking the action. Here are the six ways to conjugate verbs (in present tense) with regards to the subject pronoun at hand.  

Spanish verbs end in either -ar, -er, or -ir. To use the following present tense conjugation table, simply replace the ending (to get the "stem"), and then attach the correct suffix in the corresponding cell.  

| Replace...      | -ar   | -er   | -ir   |
|-----------------|-------|-------|-------|
| yo              | -o    | -o    | -o    |
| tú              | -as   | -es   | -es   |
| él/ellas/Ud.    | -a    | -e    | -e    |
| nosotros        | -amos | -emos | -imos |
| vosotros        | -áis  | -éis  | -ís   |
| ellos(-as)/Uds. | -an   | -en   | -en   |
